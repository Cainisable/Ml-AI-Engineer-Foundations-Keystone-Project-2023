    "###### Welcome to my Etsy Analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis I have examined this data set: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/polartech/1m-etsy-shops-sales-data\n",
    "\n",
    "In it is the top 20,000 Etsy shops (by sales) as of April 3rd, 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this, there are some limitations, as newer shops with lower total sales will not be included. Additionally, precise information about each shop (information on their actual listings for example) are not included, and therefore manual analysis may be needed to determine what sets apart the top performing shops. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, shops that rely on higher priced listings with lower sales quantity will likely be missing from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What you will find in this analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most popular terms in shop headlines with the ability to search for specifc keywords.\n",
    "- Which headline keywords are most correlated with average annual sales (with the ability to search for specific keywords)\n",
    "- Determine correlation between two variables, and create a scatter plot with essential shop data for further analysis.\n",
    "- Lastly, what effect free shipping has on sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that I have examined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- correlation between shop age and total sales\n",
    "- correlation between shop age and average annual sales\n",
    "- correlation between listing count and average annual sales for both physical and digital product shops. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions can be tweaked to dig further into the data as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Based on the findings in this analysis, a few things become clear:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Having more listings does seem to be correlated with having greater overall sales to some minor extent. \n",
    "- Free shipping may have some positive effect on sales but does not appear statistically significant.\n",
    "- Shop age does not seem to be correlated with sales success. \n",
    "\n",
    "Average annual sales appears negative for older shops, but this is likely due to Etsy's growth as a platform over recent years."
